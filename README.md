The RAP Champions network has enhanced the capability of statisticians across government. 
RAPs are reproducible analytical pipelines which improve the quality and reduce the workload of statistical products. 
The aim of the RAP Champions network has been to prepare departments for the introduction of RAP processes.

-	What is RAP?

RAP is a methodology for automating the bulk of steps involved in creating a statistical report, whilst allowing analysis to be reproduced in the future.

-	Collaboration which improved data and methods
  - RAP Champions collaborated to build capability in using reproducible analytical pipelines across government

The RAP Champions network has pioneered collaborative ways of working to build capability in reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) across government. 
This increased capability in RAP methods has led and will lead to better quality statistical outputs, delivered in a more timely manner, more efficiently. 

-	Collaboration directly improved methods

Undoing blockers.

-	Open use of github allows other organisations to reduce workload for further outputs.

The RAP Champions have used new communications technology like slack. 
This has facilitated cross-government knowledge sharing and working.  
\[DN: How do we show how this improves capability/methods?]

-	RAP meet-ups

RAP meet-ups have allowed the community to develop

-	RAP Companion

The RAP companion is an open-source knowledge base discussing all aspects of RAP implementation in government.

Aoife O’Neill (DWP) notes "RAP champs contacting each other and sharing ideas across departments? @lauraselby_dfe met and answered all my questions around Feb 2018, since then I've had phone calls with MOD, Anna Price's team at NHS Scotland, a linked in message from a stato at the home office who I've pointed to RAP resources and several conversations with VOA (an arms length body of HMRC) the intel obtained from Laura meant I could challenge conventional wisdom in my department which sometimes pushed back on RAP/open source, without which I don't think I would have gotten any traction with regards to RAP. Now trying to pass this on "

-	RAP website

The RAP website is hosted on github. This has allowed RAP Champions to contribute their knowledge directly to the website, by opening discussions and issues, and allowing participation from other Champions. These discussions remain in place and allow previous conversations to be referenced when identifying new ways forwards e.g. packrat as best practice. Previously, packrat was identified as the best dependency management solution for R; however, following discussion amongst RAP Champions, it was agreed to caveat this and offer alternative approaches in the shared documentation – leaving open the discussion for future technologies. 

-	Ways of collaborating?

-	Using new platforms (slack, github)

The RAP Champions network, aside from hosting face-to-face meetups, maintains contact using slack – an internet chat room which enables in-depth discussions and facilitates knowledge sharing. The slack group is well attended with 532 members with approximately 135 messages posted per month.

-	Training
  -	MOOC
  
The network has promoted work from its members, including the RAP massive open online course (MOOC) produced by Matthew Gregory. 
This MOOC is a strong example of knowledge sharing… Impact? 5668 enrolments, 4.13 stars 
“Really excellent, hands on, project-oriented course. 
The course teaches very useful principles for coding practice and a variety of tools that aid not only in RAP. 
I find it as one of the best courses for pipeline automation. 
You would be hard pressed to find R courses on Udemy so rich in resources and so neatly packaged. 
Can't recommend it more!”

-	RAP Companion is a collaborative effort
-	RAP meet-ups
-	RAP case studies
-	Collaboration which enhanced the insight and understanding of the findings
-	RAP improves clarity, enables linking data
-	Collaboration with stakeholders such as other teams in your department, ogds, organisations outside government, topic and method experts, other analytical professions, policy professionals, producers of related statistics, international organisations, and researchers

-	RAP Champions network exists across departments and professions

The network is inter-departmental with DN:x departments represented.
The network is across all analytical professions, drawing in expertise from different backgrounds.

-	RAP Champions become topic and method experts and can disseminate knowledge within their respective departments

The network and collaboration enable Champions to become method experts. 
They are then able to disseminate knowledge within their departments, and they can bring back views/practice from their departments to the network. 
This contributes to the knowledge base.
Edisa Livingstone (MOJ) notes “From my point of view, my RAP champion Aidan has been vital in progressing RAP within my team. 
This is because I am in a production heavy team which also receives a large amount of FOIs and PQs, therefore I simply wouldn’t have time to attend meetings or organise R or GitHub training on my own. 
Apart from providing a wealth of training courses through his Statistical Project Delivery Team which I have enjoyed, he coordinates the RAP approach and crucially straddles the gap between our HoP/senior analysts and the statistical teams themselves with regular catch-ups. 
This encourages a better understanding of the challenges and benefits of RAPping amongst the higher levels which we need to be able to take RAP forward.
Being the only RAPper embedded in a busy production team is challenging within itself, but the RAP champion creates an extra level of support at the frontline of statistical production. 
He makes the time to keep up-to-date with RAP across MoJ and makes it easier to share knowledge across teams. 
For example, through his RAP meetings I am aware of work Katherine Breeze has collaborated on with Karik about lookups which my own team will be able to take forward.”
